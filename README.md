# python-deliberate-practice
## Motivation
As a part of my journey in becoming a better full stack data scientist, I decided to improve my python skills to be able to do production level coding by writing modular and reusable code. I haven seen that an important part of machine learning comes since data collection, pipelines to deploying. For this reason, mastering python as language for ML would be very useful in my path to become a full stack data scientist.
## Deliberate Practice
I consider that the best way to hone my skills is by doing little projects that help to put in practice whatever theory I read about python. I can combine a mix of self-activities with activities in my current job.
