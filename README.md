# python-deliberate-practice
## Motivation
As a part of my journey in becoming a better full stack data scientist, I decided to improve my python skills to be able to do production level coding by writing modular and reusable code. I have seen that an important part of machine learning is actually deploying the model and have a good practices in software engineering. For this reason, mastering python as language for ML would be very useful in my path to improve my skills. I must mention this learning plan is based in the following post and git repository: https://medium.com/@rchang/how-i-build-learning-projects-part-i-54dbaad68961 - https://github.com/robert8138/python-deliberate-practice/blob/master/README.md. This repository is pretty much based on that with just a few changes to adjust it to my own goals.
## Deliberate Practice
I consider that the best way to hone my skills is by doing little projects that help me to put in practice whatever theory I read about python. I can combine a mix of self-activities with activities in my current job. 

* __Identify the Top Performers__: Given that in my current job I am the first data scientist, I cannot have a proper role model for ML but maybe the data engineer can help me check my general python program. Also meetups should be a good starting to meet more senior people in data science.

* __Targeted practice__: If I force myself to do most of the plots in dashboards using matplot lib instead of the built-in graphs I would be able to get the practice and get better at making good plots.

* __Immediate Feedbacks__: I think for this part it is going to be hard given I cannot tell people to check my pandas code. The best I can do is to start working with the DE to implement some of my python ideas into tables in our database.

## Performance goals
* __[Immediate]__ Learn about the best ways to write pythonic code.
* __[Short term]__ First, to refresh and learn all the basic data structures for data science. Second, write modular and tested code (also including parsing data from json files). Finally, improve my production level code by mastering the uses of classes and practice by writing my own sklearn estimators to build pipelines.

## Project Goals
* __Outcome__ : I want to improve my production level code skills. This means all my code would be as pythonic as possible (like following PEP 8, using try and assert, correct docstrings and standards) and with a good use of OOP to create classes to handle any data pipeline from cleaning to modeling.

* __Curriculum__: Everything from data structures to all basic materials in Pandas/Matplotlib combo. Learn about OOP, unit test and working with the cloud and github.

* __Timeframe__: All basic structures, basic task and classes by the end of 2019. Then from there I may start including more advanced concepts like optimizing my code for speed and other libraries like dask.
